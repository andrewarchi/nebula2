# Nebula 2

Nebula 2 is a toolchain for the Whitespace programming language.

It aims to bring excellent tooling to Whitespace, with planned components
including an optimizing compiler, modular intermediate language, interpreter,
and language server.

## Other projects

The [Whitespace Corpus](https://github.com/wspace/corpus) is a collection and
comparison of other projects for Whitespace and aims to catalog every
implementation.

Nebula 2 is the successor to [Nebula](https://github.com/andrewarchi/nebula),
an optimizing Whitespace compiler, written in Go, that uses static
single-assignment form for its own intermediate representation and lowers to
LLVM IR.
